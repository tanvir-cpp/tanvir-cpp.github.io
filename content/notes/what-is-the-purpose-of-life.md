# What is the purpose of life?

It is the oldest question in the book. Philosophers, theologians, and scientists have spent millennia trying to answer it. In the context of our digital existence, where we define objects, classes, and expected returns, life feels frustratingly like a function with no return type.

`void life(Time t) { ... }`

## The Algorithm of Existence

If we look at life through the lens of a system, it appears chaotic. There is no clear documentation, the API is constantly changing, and legacy code (our history) often breaks new implementations.

> "Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced." — Søren Kierkegaard

### Variable Definitions

Perhaps we are defining the variables wrong. We optimize for:
-   `wealth++`
-   `status++`
-   `efficiency++`

But the garbage collector comes for us all eventually. The memory we allocate is temporary.

## Seeking Connection vs. Seeking Output

In modern backend architecture, we talk about **Event-Driven Design**. Systems react to events—a user logs in, a payment is processed. Life is remarkably similar. It isn't about the static state of "being successful." It's about how we handle the events.

*   **The Error Handling**: How do you react when you lose someone?
*   **The Latency**: How do you handle the waiting periods where nothing seems to happen?
*   **The Handshake**: How do you connect with another human being securely and authentically?

### The Bengali Perspective

Growing up, I often heard:
> “জীবন মানে যুদ্ধ নয়, জীবন মানে উপলব্ধি।”
> *(Life is not a war, life is a realization.)*

We complicate it. We try to compile it into a binary success/failure executable. But life is interpreted. It runs line by line, moment by moment.

## Conclusion: The Infinite Loop

Maybe the purpose isn't an endpoint. In computer science, an infinite loop is usually a bug. In life, the loop of waking up, trying, loving, failing, and trying again is the feature.

**The purpose of life is to simply be part of the computation.** To contribute a bit of logic, a bit of data, or maybe just a comment that helps the next person understand the code a little better.
