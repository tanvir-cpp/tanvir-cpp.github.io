Fonts matter. As developers, we stare at text for 8+ hours a day. Here are my top picks for legibility and aesthetics.

## 1. JetBrains Mono
The default for a reason. Excellent ligature support and specifically designed for reading code.
`"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono"`

## 2. Geist Mono
Vercel's masterpiece. Clean, geometric, and perfectly balanced. Great for UI/UX work as well.

## 3. Dank Mono
A paid font, but worth it if you like a bit of cursive flair in your `italic` keywords.

## 4. Fira Code
The classic. If you love ligatures (=> turning into an arrow), this is the one.

## 5. IBM Plex Mono
Industrial, sharp, and highly legible. It feels very "engineering-focused".

## Honorable Mention: Operator Mono
For those who want their code to look like a script from the 1800s (in a good way).
