# Effective Go

> [**Read Effective Go**](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)

Go is a language that values simplicity and readability. "Effective Go" is the official guide to writing *idiomatic* Go code.

## Highlights

*   **Formatting**: Using `gofmt` is not optional.
*   **Concurrency**: "Share memory by communicating, don't communicate by sharing memory."
*   **Interfaces**: Keep interfaces small (readers/writers).
*   **Error Handling**: Errors are values. Handle them gracefully.

## My Takeaway
Writing Go like Java (factories, massive interfaces) is a common pitfall. This guide helps reset your mental model to the "Go Way".
