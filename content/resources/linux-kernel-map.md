# Linux Kernel Map

> [**Explore the Interactive Map**](https://makelinux.github.io/kernel/map/)

A fully interactive map of the Linux Kernel subsystems.

## Why explore the kernel?
As backend engineers, our code lives in User Space, but the performance depends on Kernel Space. Understanding the boundary (System Calls) is crucial.

## Key Subsystems
*   **System Call Interface**: The gateway to the kernel.
*   **Virtual File System (VFS)**: The abstraction layer for filesystems.
*   **Process Scheduler**: Determines which process runs on the CPU.
*   **Memory Management**: Paging, swapping, and virtual memory.

This map helps visualize how your HTTP request eventually translates to network packets and disk I/O.
