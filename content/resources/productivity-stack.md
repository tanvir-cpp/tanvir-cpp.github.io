Here is the software and hardware stack that manages my entire life and workflow in 2026.

## The Core

**1. Notion**
The central operating system for my life. I use it for:
- Project Management
- Note-taking (Zettelkasten method)
- Goal Tracking

**2. Todoist**
For quick capture and daily task execution. The natural language input is unbeatable.

**3. Raycast**
The spotlight replacement for Mac. I use it to manage clipboard history, window management, and quick scripts.

## Development

- **Editor:** VS Code (Neovim mode)
- **Terminal:** Warp
- **Browser:** Arc Browser

## Hardware

- **MacBook Pro M4 Max:** The powerhouse.
- **Keychron Q1 Pro:** Mechanical keyboard with banana switches.
- **Logitech MX Master 3S:** Considering upgrading to trackball, but this remains king.
