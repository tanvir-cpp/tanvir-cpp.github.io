This is one of the most comprehensive resources for learning how to design large-scale systems.

## Key Concepts Covered

*   **Scalability**: Vertical vs Horizontal scaling.
*   **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication.
*   **Caching**: Caching strategies (Write-through, Write-back), Eviction policies.
*   **Messaging**: Queues, Pub-Sub systems (Kafka/RabbitMQ).

## Why I recommend it

It's not just theory; it provides real-world examples of how systems like Twitter, Pastebin, and YouTube are architected. For any backend engineer, mastering these concepts is non-negotiable.
